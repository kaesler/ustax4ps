# Federal and State(MA) tax calculator and predictor

Simplified to cover my own needs.

Ignored:
  - standard deduction adjustment for blindness
  - married filing statuses
  - various phaseouts for high incomes


Build: spago build 
Test: spago Test
Bundle: spago bundle-app
Upgrade psc 10 0.15.15
 I upgraded psc globally with: npm install -g purescript@0.15.15
 Then I spago upgrade-set to get the new psc version into packages.dhall
 Then I deleted output/*
 Then I spago build; spago test
 
 npx purs --version

 It seems spago needs esbuild installed so I did "npm install -g esbuild"
